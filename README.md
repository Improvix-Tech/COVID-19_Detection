6.  Data Limitations:
    The limitation of this project is limited primarily to lack of available data. Only 109 counties out of over 3,000 counties participated in the wastewater project. This translates to a representation of 54 million people from a total US population of 329 million. Furthermore, wastewater concentrations were unavailable for many counties for a 4 month period between October 2021 and February 2022.
